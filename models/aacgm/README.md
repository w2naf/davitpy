# AACGM v2 Software C

## Instructions:

1. Download the coefficients and put them in a convenient directory

2. Set the environment variable `AACGM_v2_DAT_PREFIX` to the directory that
   you are storing the coefficients in AND include the prefix of the
   coefficient files, i.e., `aacgm_coeffs-11-`

   e.g.:
```
AACGM_v2_DAT_PREFIX=/mnt/thayerfs/shepherd/AACGM/idl/coeffs/aacgm_coeffs-11-
```
   Note that if you used the old AACGM software from JHU/APL you should have
   a similar variable already set.

3. Untar the contents of the .tar file into a directory

4. Build the test program by running:
```
   gcc -o test_aacgm test_aacgm.c aacgmlib_v2.c -lm -static
```

   Note that on older systems you might need to remove the `-static` flag

5. Run the test program by running:

```
   test_aacgm
```

   The output should look something like:

```

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. The function `AACGM_v2_Convert` is a direct replacement for the function
   `AACGMConvert` that is used in much of the SD software. This is your
   starting point, but you can modify the test program as you like.

2. New user-space functions have been added that allow users to set the
   date and time. The functions are:
```
       AACGM_v2_SetDateTime(int year, int month, int day, int hour,
                        int minute, int second);

       AACGM_v2_SetNow();
```
   The latter will use the current computer date and time in UT.

   Note that setting the time frequently triggers an interpolation in time and
   in altitude, which will slow the calculations. Testing should be done to
   determine what the correspondence between changes in time and AACGM lat/lon
   are.

3. You must set the date and time at least once or the code will not run.

4. A new user-space function has been added that allow users to see what
   date and time are being used. The function is:
```
       AACGM_v2_GetDateTime(int *year, int *month, int *day, int *hour,
                        int *minute, int *second, int *doy);
```

# Python Extension

## Build and Installation

A python extension has been included to allow python access to the end-user
C methods.  To build and install the python extension for your entire system:

`sudo python setup.py install`

Or, to install it just for your user:

`python setup.py install --user`

## Testing
The included `test_aacgm.py` script serves as both a test and a crib sheet for
the AACGMv2 python API.  Run the test script with:

`python test_aacgm.py`

You should get an output very similar to running the C test routine above.
